# Church Management — Demo-Ready MVP

This monorepo packages a complete walkthrough of the PRD using mock data only. You get:

| Surface   | Highlights                                                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API**   | NestJS (Fastify), in-memory mock store, OAuth-style demo login, OpenAPI docs           |
| **Web**   | Next.js App Router + React + Tailwind + PWA service worker + shadcn-style UI seeds     |
| **Data**  | Members, groups, events, announcements, giving, seeded sessions (no Postgres required) |
| **Tests** | Jest (API smoke) and Playwright (dashboard e2e)                                        |

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- `pnpm` (recommended via `corepack enable`)
- macOS/Linux/WSL (windows works via WSL2)

> The Prisma schema remains in the repo for future Postgres wiring, but the MVP runs entirely from the mock store. You do **not** need a database to demo the product.

---

## Installation & Environment

```bash
corepack enable             # if pnpm is not already available
pnpm install                # install workspace dependencies

# Optional – API .env (currently only used for future secrets)
cp api/.env.example api/.env

# Optional – Web env overrides (defaults already point to local API)
cp web/.env.example web/.env
```

The web env template exposes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` / `API_BASE_URL` – defaults to `http://localhost:3001/api/v1`
- `DEMO_DEFAULT_TOKEN` – defaults to `demo-admin`, used when no cookie token is present.

API runtime toggles:

- `LOG_LEVEL` controls pino structured log verbosity (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).
- `SENTRY_DSN` and optional `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` enable error reporting to Sentry.
- `AUDIT_LOG_FILE` overrides the persisted audit trail location (`storage/audit-log.json` by default).
- `AUDIT_LOG_PERSIST=false` disables audit log writes (automatically disabled during Jest runs).

---

## Run the Stacks (mock data)

In two terminals:

```bash
# API (NestJS + Fastify, in-memory store)
pnpm dev:api:mock

# Web (Next.js PWA)
pnpm -C web dev
```

Both servers hot-reload. The API serves Swagger docs at [http://localhost:3001/docs](http://localhost:3001/docs). The web app lives at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## API Docs

- Swagger now enumerates every controller (auth, users, households, groups, events, announcements, giving, dashboard, audit).
- DTOs include type metadata for request/response bodies; try the “Try it out” button on any route at `http://localhost:3001/docs`.
- Generic schemas are used for nested mock payloads so the docs stay useful even as the backing store swaps between mock and future Prisma modes.

---

## Data Modes

The API chooses its backing store via `DATA_MODE`:

- `mock` _(default)_ – uses the in-memory `MockDatabaseService`. This is what CI and the Playwright smoke suite run against.
- Additional modes (e.g. `prisma`) will be wired up as the persistent layer lands. Choosing an unsupported value currently throws a helpful error so you know to keep the flag on `mock`.

Examples:

```bash
# Unix/macOS
DATA_MODE=mock pnpm -C api dev          # explicit mock mode

# Windows (PowerShell)
$Env:DATA_MODE = "mock"; pnpm -C api dev
```

The helper scripts (`pnpm dev:api:mock`, `pnpm test:e2e:mock`) wrap those exports for convenience.

---

## Authentication

- **Production flows:** `/auth/google` and `/auth/facebook` perform real OAuth handshakes (Passport strategies) and issue signed JWT access tokens. Configure the providers with:
  - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL`
  - `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID`, `FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`, `FACEBOOK_CALLBACK_URL`
  - `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` _(optional, defaults to 1h)_
  - `WEB_APP_URL` _(used to send users back to the Next.js app on success)_
- **Demo shortcut:** POST `/auth/login` with `{ email, provider, role }` still works for the seeded accounts and returns both the historical mock token and a JWT. The login screen also exposes a “demo mode” button that sets the `demo-admin` session without leaving the app.
- If no Bearer token is provided and demo mode is enabled, the API falls back to `demo-admin` so unauthenticated users can still explore the UI.
- The Next.js callback route stores the JWT in an httpOnly `session_token` cookie; a companion `session_provider` cookie (non-HTTP-only) lets the UI surface which path the user took.

## Feature Walkthrough

- **Dashboard** – snapshot cards (members, groups, events, giving), next events, unread announcements, and recent contributions.
- **Member Directory** – search by name/email, view profiles with groups, attendance history, giving records.
- **Groups** – roster, meeting schedule, taxonomy, linked upcoming events.
- **Events & Attendance** – event list with inline attendance form (writes back to the mock store).
- **Announcements** – feed with read tracking and basic audience metadata.
- **Giving** – manual ledger with create form and seeded funds.
- **Audit Log** – admin-only view of recent activity with filters for entity, actor, and date range.
- **Auth** – mock Google/Facebook flows with role assignment.
- **Households** – household listing and detail views.
- **PWA** – manifest + service worker pre-cache key routes for offline dashboard snapshots (install via browser menu).
- **Theming** – switch between light and dark modes.
- **Requests** – a unified form for members to submit various types of requests (Prayer, Benevolence, Improvements/Suggestions).

## Mock Data Source

- Canonical seed data lives in `api/src/mock/mock-data.ts`.
- By default (`DATA_MODE=mock`), runtime operations go through the in-memory data store so the app “feels real” without a database.

---

## Styling & UI

- **Theming**: The application supports both **light and dark themes**. A theme switcher is located in the header.
- **Component Library**: UI components are built with Tailwind CSS and follow the conventions of `shadcn/ui`. Core components can be found in `web/components/ui`.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: The main navigation sidebar now includes icons for each item to improve usability. The active page is highlighted.
- **UI Automation IDs**: All interactive elements have a unique `id` attribute for testability.

---

## Observability

- Structured JSON logging via `pino`; adjust verbosity with `LOG_LEVEL`.
  - Local tail: `pnpm dev:api:mock | pino-pretty` (or any JSON log viewer) to watch request lifecycle and bootstrap events.
  - Each entry includes `service`, `environment`, and contextual payloads so you can ship logs straight to ELK/Loki.
- Global HTTP error filter returns consistent payloads and forwards 5xx responses to Sentry when `SENTRY_DSN` is set.
  - Configure `SENTRY_DSN` (+ optional `SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE`) in `api/.env`, restart the API, and verify by hitting a failing route—the error shows up in Sentry with method/path metadata.
- Prometheus-friendly metrics live at `/api/v1/metrics` (request counts and latency histogram).
  - Curl locally: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/metrics`.
  - Prometheus scrape example:

    ```yaml
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'church-api'
        static_configs:
          - targets: ['localhost:3001']
        metrics_path: /api/v1/metrics
    ```

  - Grafana tips: plot `rate(church_app_http_requests_total[5m])` for throughput, and `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(church_app_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])) by (le,route))` for latency.

## PWA Notes

- Manifest (`web/public/manifest.json`) and service worker (`web/public/service-worker.js`) are included.
- The service worker caches core read screens for offline demos.
- Install the app via your browser menu to experience the PWA shell.

---

## Accessibility

- Global skip link lets keyboard and assistive tech users bypass navigation.
- Primary and secondary navigation landmarks expose descriptive `aria-label`s.
- Listings tables now ship with captions and scoped column headers for screen readers.
- Search inputs include associated labels (visually hidden) to satisfy WCAG form requirements.
- Playwright E2E suite includes automated checks for skip link focus, labelled navigation, and table captions (`pnpm -C web test:e2e`).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                            | Fix                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@fastify/static` missing          | Run `pnpm -C api install` (already in `package.json`).                                       |
| TypeScript packages missing in web | `pnpm -C web install` ensures `@types/node`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom` are present. |
| API shows ESM module errors        | Ensure `api/tsconfig.json` still targets `"module": "commonjs"` and rerun `pnpm -C api dev`. |
| Playwright needs browsers          | `pnpm -C web exec playwright install` installs the chromium snapshot.                        |

Enjoy the demo, and feel free to swap the mock layer for Prisma + Postgres when you’re ready for production data.
