# Church Management App - Codespaces Demo

This Codespaces environment is configured to run the full Church Management App demo with mock data.

## What's Running

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: <http://localhost:3000>
- **API (NestJS)**: <http://localhost:3001>
- **API Documentation**: <http://localhost:3001/docs>

## Demo Features

The app includes:

- Member directory with role-based access
- Groups/ministries management
- Events and attendance tracking
- Announcements and communications
- Manual giving records
- Pastoral care and prayer request system
- Child check-in safety features
- PWA capabilities with offline support

## Authentication

For demo purposes, use the `demo-admin` token which is automatically set for development.

## Getting Started

1. The servers start automatically when the Codespace opens
2. Wait for both servers to be ready (check the terminal output)
3. **Find the Ports panel**: Look at the bottom of VS Code for a "PORTS" tab (next to TERMINAL,
   OUTPUT, etc.)

### Option A: Automatic Port Forwarding (Recommended)

- Click the globe icons (üåê) next to ports 3000 and 3001 to open them in new browser tabs

### Option B: Manual Port Forwarding (if globe icons don't appear)

- Click the **"Forward a Port"** button in the PORTS panel
- Enter `3000` and press Enter (for the web app)
- Enter `3001` and press Enter (for the API)
- Click the globe icons that appear next to the forwarded ports

4. Start exploring the app!

## Development

If you need to restart the servers:

- API: `cd api && DATA_MODE=mock pnpm start`
- Web: `cd web && pnpm dev`

## Mock Data

All data is stored in memory using the mock database service. Changes persist during the session but
reset when the Codespace restarts.
