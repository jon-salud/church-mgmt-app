# Tasks

## Work Tracker

Use this file as the single source of truth for what has shipped in the demo MVP and what is still outstanding. Update it whenever a task meaningfully progresses so the next agent can pick up quickly. When you pull an item from backlog, move it into **In Progress** before you begin work.
