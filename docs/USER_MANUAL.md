# Church Management System: User Manual

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Church Management System! This manual is your guide to using the platform, whether
you are a Church Administrator responsible for managing your church's community or a Member looking
to connect and engage. Our goal is to provide you with an intuitive and powerful set of tools to
streamline church operations and enhance your ministry.

## 2. Getting Started

When you log in for the first time, you will be greeted by the main dashboard, which provides a
quick overview of key church activities. The main navigation menu on the left side of the screen is
your primary tool for accessing all the features described in this manual.
