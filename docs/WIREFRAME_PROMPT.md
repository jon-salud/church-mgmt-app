# Generating Wireframes with AI

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a guide on how to generate effective wireframes using a large language model
(LLM) with image generation capabilities. The key is to provide a highly detailed and structured
prompt that leaves little room for ambiguity.

A good wireframe prompt should be structured like a specification document, clearly defining the
layout, components, and user interactions. This ensures the generated image is a functional
blueprint rather than just a vague visual concept.
