# Board of Trustees Persona Notes

- **Context:** Governance body providing oversight on legal, financial, and ethical compliance; engaged periodically rather than daily.
- **What they need:** High-level dashboards on compliance metrics, audit-ready reports, access controls for sensitive documents, and evidence of data protection.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Focuses on operational admin workflows without explicit governance outputs, trustee access, or compliance reporting.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Define audit log accessibility, compliance reporting cadence, board-specific permissions, and workflows for approvals or policy acknowledgements.
