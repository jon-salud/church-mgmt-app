# Persona: Board of Trustees

## Overview
- Governance body (volunteer or appointed) ensuring legal, financial, and ethical stewardship.
- Engages periodically for reviews, approvals, and strategic oversight rather than daily operations.
- Requires curated insights and secure access to sensitive documents.

## Primary Goals
- Verify compliance with legal requirements, denominational standards, and internal policies.
- Oversee financial health, risk management, and safeguarding of member data.
- Provide accountability to the congregation and external stakeholders.
- Support strategic decisions with trustworthy data and trend analysis.

## Key Responsibilities
- Review financial statements, budgets, and variance reports.
- Monitor risk registers, incident reports, and safeguarding cases.
- Approve major initiatives, capital projects, or policy changes.
- Document governance decisions and ensure they are communicated properly.

## Pain Points
- Difficulty obtaining accurate, up-to-date reports without manual compilation.
- Security concerns when accessing sensitive documents via ad-hoc channels.
- Limited visibility into compliance status, leading to reactive rather than proactive oversight.
- Lack of context around incidents or emerging risks due to fragmented data.

## Core Journeys
1. **Quarterly Board Meeting:** Receive secure briefing pack → review dashboards → annotate questions → record decisions.
2. **Incident Oversight:** Receive notification of major incident → access detailed report → monitor remediation steps → log outcome.
3. **Policy Approval:** Review proposed policy updates → gather feedback → vote/approve → trigger notification to administrators.
4. **Audit Preparation:** Access compliance dashboard → download required documentation → liaise with auditors → capture findings.

## Feature Requirements
- Governance dashboard summarizing finance, compliance, risk, and key ministry metrics.
- Secure document portal with versioning, permissions, and acknowledgment tracking.
- Workflow tools for approvals, voting, and decision logging with audit trails.
- Notification system for incidents, policy updates, and compliance deadlines.
- Ability to leave comments/questions visible to administrators and relevant staff.

## Data & Permissions
- Read access to financial summaries, risk reports, safeguarding logs, and key documents.
- Limited write access to governance records (meeting minutes, decisions).
- Explicit exclusions from day-to-day pastoral notes unless escalated through policy.
- Access should be time-bound and revocable; every view/download must be logged.

## Success Metrics
- Governance meetings start with complete, accurate briefing materials.
- Time-to-review for incidents and policy updates meets established targets.
- Compliance indicators (audits passed, filings on time) stay within acceptable ranges.
- Trustees report confidence in data accuracy and security of the system.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- What legal frameworks (e.g., charity law, safeguarding regulations) must the system support for trustees?
- Do trustees require digital signatures or voting within the platform?
- How should sensitive incidents be escalated to trustees while respecting confidentiality?
- What archival policies are needed for governance records?
