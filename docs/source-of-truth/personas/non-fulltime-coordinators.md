# Persona: Non-Fulltime Coordinators (Ministry Coordinators / Deacons)

## Overview
- Volunteer coordinators overseeing service areas such as hospitality, childcare, worship, outreach.
- Manage rosters, schedules, and resources while juggling other commitments.
- Need straightforward tools to organize volunteers and communicate expectations.

## Primary Goals
- Ensure ministry roles are filled and volunteers are prepared for duties.
- Communicate schedules, updates, and training materials efficiently.
- Track participation, substitutes, and feedback to improve ministry quality.
- Collaborate with staff and other coordinators for cross-ministry events.

## Key Responsibilities
- Build and maintain volunteer rosters with availability and skill information.
- Schedule volunteers for events/services, handle swaps or replacements.
- Distribute necessary resources (training docs, checklists) to volunteers.
- Capture attendance and issues to report back to staff or leadership.

## Pain Points
- Manual scheduling via spreadsheets or messaging apps is error-prone.
- Last-minute cancellations cause stress without rapid replacement tools.
- Communication across multiple channels leads to inconsistent messaging.
- Limited insight into volunteer engagement trends hampers retention efforts.

## Core Journeys
1. **Monthly Scheduling:** Review upcoming services → check volunteer availability → assign roles → publish schedule.
2. **Day-of Coordination:** Confirm attendance → handle no-shows → update roster → notify staff of gaps.
3. **Resource Distribution:** Upload training material → assign to new volunteers → track completion acknowledgement.
4. **Volunteer Care:** Identify volunteers with low participation → send check-in message → log response.

## Feature Requirements
- Scheduling interface with templates, drag-and-drop assignments, and conflict detection.
- Volunteer availability management (self-service updates, blackout dates).
- Automated reminders and confirmation workflows for assigned volunteers.
- Communication tools with segmentation (e.g., childcare team) and logging of sent messages.
- Feedback capture mechanism for volunteers to report issues or satisfaction.
- Basic analytics highlighting coverage gaps, participation rates, and volunteer churn.

## Data & Permissions
- Access to volunteer profiles specific to their ministry, including contact info and skills.
- Permission to update schedules, mark attendance, and add notes visible to staff.
- Restricted from sensitive member data outside volunteer context.
- Ability to request additional volunteers from wider pool with admin oversight.

## Success Metrics
- Coverage rate for scheduled ministries (percentage of roles filled on time).
- Reduction in last-minute cancellations or unfilled positions.
- Volunteer retention and engagement scores across assigned ministries.
- Coordinator satisfaction with scheduling and communication workflows.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- Will coordinators use mobile interfaces primarily, and are offline tools necessary?
- How should the system handle multi-ministry volunteers to avoid double-booking?
- Do coordinators require integrations with other scheduling tools (e.g., Planning Center)?
- What guardrails are needed to ensure equitable volunteer load distribution?
