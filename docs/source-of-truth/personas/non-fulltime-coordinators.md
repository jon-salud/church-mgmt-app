# Non-Fulltime Coordinators Persona Notes

- **Context:** Volunteer coordinators or deacons managing specific service areas (e.g., childcare, ushering, outreach) with limited administrative time.
- **What they need:** Scheduling tools, clear volunteer rosters, communications support, and lightweight task tracking tailored to their ministry area.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Volunteer management is simultaneously tagged as future work and partially scoped, creating uncertainty for this personaâ€™s critical workflows.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Clarify roadmap sequencing for volunteer coordination, document minimal viable scheduling/communication tools, and ensure accessibility for non-technical users.
