# Persona: Non-Fulltime Church Leaders (Small Group Leaders)

## Overview
- Volunteer leaders overseeing small groups, ministry clusters, or demographic cohorts.
- Balance ministry responsibilities with careers and family; need intuitive, time-efficient tools.
- Frequently interact with members for discipleship, care, and coordination.

## Primary Goals
- Shepherd assigned members by tracking attendance, engagement, and pastoral needs.
- Plan and facilitate group meetings, studies, or outreach activities.
- Share resources and communicate effectively with group members.
- Report group health back to staff or church leaders.

## Key Responsibilities
- Maintain accurate group rosters and member contact information.
- Log pastoral care interactions or escalations to staff.
- Organize meeting schedules, attendance, and follow-up assignments.
- Distribute curriculum, announcements, and event information to the group.

## Pain Points
- Limited time to learn complex systems; require streamlined experiences.
- Lack of visibility into member engagement trends makes pastoral follow-up harder.
- Difficulty coordinating schedules and communications without integrated tools.
- Need confidence that private pastoral notes remain confidential.

## Core Journeys
1. **Weekly Group Prep:** Review group dashboard → note attendance trends → send reminder → download/share study materials.
2. **Meeting Follow-Up:** Mark attendance → log pastoral notes → assign follow-up tasks → escalate urgent needs to staff.
3. **Resource Sharing:** Upload or link resource → set visibility → notify members via preferred channel.
4. **Reporting Insight:** Generate summary of group health → send to church staff/admin with observations.

## Feature Requirements
- Lightweight leader portal or mobile-friendly interface focused on group management.
- Attendance tracking with quick input methods and engagement indicators (streaks, absences).
- Pastoral notes with confidentiality controls and escalation workflows.
- Communication tools (email/SMS/in-app) with templates tailored to small groups.
- Resource library integration or quick link sharing tied to group context.
- Guidance and tips surfaced contextually (e.g., leader best practices, discipleship prompts).

## Data & Permissions
- Access restricted to their assigned groups and household leaders linked to those members.
- Can view basic member profiles, attendance history, and pastoral notes they authored or are permitted to see.
- Cannot access sensitive financial data or global request queues outside their scope.
- Ability to escalate issues, triggering alerts to staff with necessary context.

## Success Metrics
- Consistent meeting attendance and retention across assigned groups.
- Timely escalation of pastoral needs to staff (measured by response SLAs).
- Leader satisfaction with tooling and reduction in manual tracking.
- Increased member engagement metrics compared to groups without digital support.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- What offline capabilities (e.g., printable attendee lists) are needed for leaders meeting in homes?
- Should leaders have access to gamified engagement metrics or goal tracking?
- How will onboarding/training be delivered to ensure adoption among new leaders?
- Are there denominational policies governing volunteer data access that must be enforced?
