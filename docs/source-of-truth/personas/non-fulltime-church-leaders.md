# Non-Fulltime Church Leaders (Small Group Leaders) Persona Notes

- **Context:** Volunteer leaders shepherding small groups or ministries, often balancing responsibilities with other jobs.
- **What they need:** Simple dashboards for group membership and engagement, pastoral care alerts, resource sharing tools, and guided follow-up workflows.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Provides basic group resource sharing but lacks leader-facing dashboards, analytics, or pastoral tooling aimed at volunteers.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Specify lightweight leader portal requirements, notification preferences, and guardrails for accessing sensitive member data while honoring privacy.
