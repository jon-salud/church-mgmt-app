# Persona: Church Leader

## Overview
- Pastoral or ministry leader responsible for shepherding members, guiding ministries, and coordinating volunteers.
- Relies on actionable insights rather than raw data; may not be deeply technical.
- Requires tools that balance ministry sensitivity with operational follow-through.

## Primary Goals
- Track member spiritual health, care needs, and engagement across ministries.
- Coordinate pastoral care efforts with staff and other leaders.
- Monitor ministry-specific metrics (group participation, event follow-up, prayer needs).
- Communicate effectively with members and volunteers while respecting privacy.

## Key Responsibilities
- Review and act on pastoral care/prayer requests relevant to their ministry.
- Follow up on attendance dips, engagement alerts, or discipleship milestones.
- Assign tasks to staff/volunteers and confirm completion.
- Report back to church administrators or leadership on ministry health.

## Pain Points
- Limited visibility into member status changes without real-time alerts.
- Difficulty collaborating on pastoral care requests without shared notes or statuses.
- Overwhelming data that lacks ministry filtering, leading to missed follow-ups.
- Unclear boundaries on what data they should access, risking privacy concerns.

## Core Journeys
1. **Daily Pastoral Check:** Log in → review dashboard of open care items → claim/assign tasks → record outcomes.
2. **Prepare Ministry Report:** Filter ministry dashboard → export summary for leadership meeting → highlight wins and concerns.
3. **Member Follow-Up:** Receive alert on member disengagement → open profile → review history → log outreach attempt.
4. **Volunteer Coordination:** Review event volunteer gaps → message targeted volunteers → track confirmations.

## Feature Requirements
- Ministry-specific dashboard with filters for care requests, attendance trends, and engagement signals.
- Task management capabilities: assign, comment, update status, add pastoral notes (with confidentiality controls).
- Integration with communication tools (email, SMS) respecting opt-in preferences.
- Automated alerts for key triggers (missed attendance streaks, urgent requests).
- Training content or guided experiences tailored for non-technical leaders.

## Data & Permissions
- Access to member data limited to ministries they oversee, with ability to request elevated access when needed.
- View and update pastoral notes flagged for their ministry; restricted from confidential data outside their scope.
- Ability to view group rosters, event rosters, and volunteer lists relevant to their assignments.
- Requires visibility into request history/audit for accountability without exposing private data unnecessarily.

## Success Metrics
- Percentage of pastoral care requests responded to within target timeframe.
- Increase in member engagement metrics for ministries under their leadership.
- Completion rate of assigned follow-up tasks and volunteer coverage.
- Leader satisfaction scores on system usability and data clarity.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- How granular should ministry-based permissions be (e.g., campus vs ministry vs small group)?
- What training or onboarding content is needed to ensure leaders adopt the platform?
- Are there legal/privacy constraints for pastoral notes that need additional safeguards?
- Should leaders have offline/print options for visits without exposing sensitive info?
