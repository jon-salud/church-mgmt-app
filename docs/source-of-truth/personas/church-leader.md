# Church Leader Persona Notes

- **Context:** Pastoral or ministry leader focused on member care and ministry outcomes; may not handle full administrative duties.
- **What they need:** Visibility into member statuses, pastoral care queues, group health indicators, and streamlined tools to respond or assign follow-ups.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Core requirements concentrate on administrators and members; scoped access for leaders to sensitive information is undefined.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Specify leader-specific permissions, outline pastoral care dashboards, and define notification/assignment flows suitable for non-technical leaders.
