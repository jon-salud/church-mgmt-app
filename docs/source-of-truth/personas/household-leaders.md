# Household Leaders Persona Notes

- **Context:** Individuals overseeing a household or dorm/unit, accountable for family updates, attendance, and discipleship check-ins.
- **What they need:** Tools to manage household profiles, attendance history, milestone tracking, and communication with staff or group leaders.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Establishes the household data model but does not define leader-specific permissions or convenience features for managing household data.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Detail household leader access rights, outline milestone/discipleship tracking requirements, and consider notification workflows for household-level updates.
