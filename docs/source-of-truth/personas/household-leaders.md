# Persona: Household Leaders

## Overview
- Individuals responsible for maintaining household information (families, dorm units, roommate clusters).
- Often parents, guardians, or appointed leaders coordinating care and discipleship within the household.
- Need simplified tools to update household data and communicate with church teams.

## Primary Goals
- Keep household member profiles accurate (contact info, emergency details, milestones).
- Track household participation in events, services, and discipleship programs.
- Ensure pastoral needs or requests are communicated promptly.
- Coordinate household-specific communications (reminders, schedules).

## Key Responsibilities
- Update household data (addresses, phone numbers, relationships).
- Respond to household-level requests for information or approvals (e.g., child check-in permissions).
- Track milestones (baptisms, classes completed) and share updates with leaders.
- Communicate with staff or group leaders about household needs.

## Pain Points
- Complex administrative portals discourage regular updates.
- Manual communication leads to inconsistent messaging across household members.
- Lack of visibility into attendance and engagement makes it hard to encourage participation.
- Difficulty retrieving historical data (past events, requests) for the household.

## Core Journeys
1. **Profile Upkeep:** Receive reminder → review household profile → update contact info → confirm changes.
2. **Milestone Tracking:** Log child dedication completion → upload documentation → notify pastoral staff.
3. **Attendance Review:** View recent attendance records → identify gaps → schedule family follow-up.
4. **Pastoral Request:** Submit household prayer need → monitor status → receive updates and close-out.

## Feature Requirements
- Household dashboard summarizing member info, attendance, milestones, and pending actions.
- Guided forms for updating profiles with validation and clarity on required fields.
- Communication tools to send messages to household members or relevant staff/leader contacts.
- Integration with check-in systems to manage permissions and emergency contacts.
- Ability to view and manage household tasks (upcoming events, forms to complete).

## Data & Permissions
- Access limited to their own household and related records.
- Can update member profiles within household, with audit trail for staff review if needed.
- Visibility into household-level requests, attendance, and milestone history.
- Restricted from broader member directory or financial giving information unless explicitly granted.

## Success Metrics
- Frequency of up-to-date household data (e.g., verification every 6 months).
- Percentage of household tasks completed on time (forms, permissions, events).
- Reduction in manual staff intervention for data corrections.
- Increased household participation in events and discipleship programs.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- Should households receive automated reminders for data verification, and at what cadence?
- Do household leaders need delegated access for older children or roommates with privacy boundaries?
- How are blended or complex households represented to avoid duplicate records?
- What incentives or prompts encourage regular household engagement with the platform?
