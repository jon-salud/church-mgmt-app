# Persona: Church Administrator (Operations/Finance)

## Overview
- Operational leader responsible for finance, facilities, HR, compliance, and governance support.
- Often collaborates with trustees, staff, and external auditors.
- Needs precision, auditability, and long-term record retention more than day-to-day ministry tools.

## Primary Goals
- Maintain accurate operational records (documents, contracts, financial reports).
- Ensure compliance with legal/regulatory requirements and denominational guidelines.
- Support budgeting, giving reconciliation, and board-level reporting.
- Manage facility logistics, resource allocation, and vendor relationships.

## Key Responsibilities
- Oversee document library organization, retention policies, and permissions.
- Reconcile giving data with accounting systems; track pledges and designated funds.
- Prepare board packets, financial statements, compliance certificates.
- Coordinate facility schedules, maintenance requests, and vendor contracts.

## Pain Points
- Fragmented systems for finance, documents, and facilities create duplicated effort.
- Lack of retention tooling risks non-compliance with document policies.
- Difficulties exporting audit-ready data with consistent formatting.
- Permissions that are too broad or too restrictive hamper collaboration with staff and volunteers.

## Core Journeys
1. **Board Meeting Prep:** Gather financial and ministry reports → compile packet → distribute securely to trustees.
2. **Document Retention:** Upload new contract → tag with retention policy → assign access roles → set review reminders.
3. **Financial Reconciliation:** Export giving data → compare with accounting system → update discrepancies → log notes.
4. **Facilities Coordination:** Review event calendar → manage room conflicts → create maintenance request → track resolution.

## Feature Requirements
- Document library with metadata tagging, retention schedules, audit trails, and secure sharing.
- Robust export/import tools for financial data, including integrations with accounting packages.
- Permission matrix supporting granular access (trustees, finance team, staff).
- Facilities management features: calendars, resource booking, maintenance workflows.
- Compliance dashboard highlighting upcoming deadlines, expiring documents, or training requirements.
- Ability to attach documents and notes to members, households, events, or requests where relevant.

## Data & Permissions
- Needs access to sensitive financial records, donor information, and confidential documents.
- Requires ability to grant time-bound access to trustees, auditors, or volunteers.
- Must track who viewed/downloaded critical documents for accountability.
- Should have read visibility into ministry metrics to contextualize financial decisions.

## Success Metrics
- Timely completion of compliance tasks (submitted reports, filed documents).
- Accuracy of finance exports (minimal discrepancies between systems).
- Reduction in time spent assembling board packets or audit materials.
- Positive audit outcomes with clear documentation and access trails.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- Which financial integrations (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero) are in scope for launch?
- How are document retention rules defined across different jurisdictions?
- Do administrators need workflow approvals (e.g., dual control for sensitive changes)?
- Should facilities management be handled in-platform or via integration with specialized tools?
