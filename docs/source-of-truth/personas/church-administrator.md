# Church Administrator Persona Notes

- **Context:** Operational/administrative role overseeing facilities, finance, compliance, and recordsâ€”not always ministry staff.
- **What they need:** Financial and facilities visibility, document retention policies, ability to manage permissions, and compliance-friendly workflows (audits, exports).
- **Current BRD coverage:** Mentions document library and request management but defers financial/giving features and lacks retention/compliance requirements.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Define document retention and access policies, outline finance/operations roadmap dependencies, and ensure reporting exports meet accountability needs.
