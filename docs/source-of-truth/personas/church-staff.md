# Church Staff Persona Notes

- **Context:** Full-time ministry staff handling day-to-day member support, care requests, and event operations.
- **What they need:** Work queues for requests, collaboration tools (notes, task assignments), follow-up reminders, and quick access to member context.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Describes basic request lifecycle states but omits staff-facing tooling such as assignments, notes, or workload balancing.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Capture requirements for staff collaboration, audit trails on actions, and integrations with communication channels or reminders.
