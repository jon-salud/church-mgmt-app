# Persona: Church Staff

## Overview
- Full-time ministry staff supporting pastoral care, events, discipleship, and administrative duties.
- Operates within defined ministries (e.g., pastoral care, events, youth) with collaborative workflows.
- Needs efficient tooling to manage high volume of requests and interactions without losing personal touch.

## Primary Goals
- Process incoming pastoral care, prayer, and general requests promptly.
- Coordinate events, volunteer schedules, and communication with stakeholders.
- Maintain accurate member records with notes from interactions.
- Ensure follow-ups happen on schedule and nothing falls through the cracks.

## Key Responsibilities
- Monitor request queues and assign or claim tasks based on workload.
- Communicate with members, leaders, and volunteers regarding support or logistics.
- Record touchpoints and outcomes in member profiles for continuity across staff.
- Support ministry leaders with reports, logistics, and resource distribution.

## Pain Points
- Manual tracking (spreadsheets/emails) leads to missed follow-ups and poor visibility.
- Limited collaboration features make handoffs between staff members cumbersome.
- Insufficient reminders or automation increase cognitive load.
- Difficulty accessing relevant member context quickly while on calls or in meetings.

## Core Journeys
1. **Request Intake:** Review queue → prioritize urgent items → claim → contact member → log outcome and next steps.
2. **Volunteer Coordination:** View event roster → monitor sign-ups vs capacity → send reminders → confirm attendance.
3. **Pastoral Support:** Join pastoral care meeting → review assigned cases → update statuses → share notes with leaders.
4. **Daily Wrap-Up:** Check outstanding tasks → set reminders for follow-up → generate daily summary for admin or leader.

## Feature Requirements
- Unified work queue with filters (ministry, urgency, status) and collaboration tools (comments, attachments).
- Task assignment and load balancing features (automated assignment, reassign, escalate).
- Reminder and notification system (email/SMS/in-app) with snooze/escalation options.
- Quick member context pane showing history, household ties, recent engagements.
- Bulk communication tools with templates and personalization when reaching members or volunteers.
- Integration hooks for calendars or task management (ICS, iCal, Outlook, etc.).

## Data & Permissions
- Access to member data relevant to assigned ministries; ability to request additional access with audit trails.
- Permission to update request statuses, member notes, and event/volunteer participation.
- Restricted from viewing sensitive financial or governance data unless specifically granted.
- Needs visibility into other staff actions for continuity but within privacy boundaries.

## Success Metrics
- Average response and resolution time for assigned requests.
- Completion rate of scheduled follow-ups and volunteer fill rate.
- Reduction in manual tracking (e.g., number of tasks handled within the system vs external tools).
- Staff satisfaction and perception of workload management improvements.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- Do ministries require unique workflows or custom fields beyond global definitions?
- What integrations (email, SMS, project management) are mandatory for staff efficiency?
- Should there be service-level agreements (SLAs) for different request types?
- How will the system support staff working in the field or offline scenarios?
