# Non-Members Persona Notes

- **Context:** Visitors, seekers, or prospective members exploring the church before committing; may have limited system access.
- **What they need:** Guest-facing touchpoints such as interest forms, follow-up tracking, event sign-ups, and clear pathways toward membership or baptism.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Assumes authenticated members for most interactions and does not address guest access or onboarding journeys.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Determine scope of unauthenticated experiences, define guest-to-member conversion workflows, and capture privacy considerations for storing seeker information.
