# Persona: Non-Members (Visitors, Seekers, Guests)

## Overview
- Individuals exploring the church, attending events, or engaging in initial discipleship steps.
- May have limited digital access (guest accounts) or interact anonymously until ready to connect.
- Critical to growth strategy—first impressions and follow-up determine retention.

## Primary Goals
- Learn about the church’s ministries, beliefs, and next steps in a welcoming environment.
- Register or RSVP for services, events, or interest meetings without friction.
- Request information, prayer, or study resources while choosing their privacy boundaries.
- Understand the path toward membership, baptism, or deeper involvement.

## Key Responsibilities
- Provide contact information when comfortable to enable follow-up.
- Respond to follow-up communications (email, SMS) from staff or volunteers.
- Attend intro events, classes, or small groups to explore commitment.
- Share feedback or questions to help the church guide them effectively.

## Pain Points
- Overly complicated forms or mandatory accounts discourage engagement.
- Lack of clarity on what happens after submitting interest or prayer requests.
- Fear of oversharing personal data without trust in privacy safeguards.
- Difficulty navigating content tailored for newcomers vs committed members.

## Core Journeys
1. **Plan a Visit:** Browse public site → learn about services → RSVP → receive welcome info.
2. **Request Follow-Up:** Submit interest form (e.g., Bible study) → receive prompt contact → schedule meeting.
3. **Attend Intro Class:** Register for newcomer event → receive reminders → check in on arrival → provide feedback.
4. **Next Steps Pathway:** Explore membership/baptism resources → track progress (class completion, interviews) → convert to member account.

## Feature Requirements
- Guest-friendly landing experiences with minimal barriers (no login required initially).
- CRM-lite follow-up system capturing interactions, preferences, and next actions.
- Automated nurture workflows (emails, SMS) segmented for visitors.
- Public event registration supporting households and friends without accounts.
- Privacy controls and consent management respecting regional regulations.
- Conversion workflow to transition guest profiles into full member accounts with data continuity.

## Data & Permissions
- Store minimal personal data until consent given; tag records as “visitor/seekers”.
- Allow staff to access visitor profiles for follow-up while safeguarding sensitive notes.
- Provide transparent data usage statements and easy opt-out mechanisms.
- Merge visitor records into member profiles without data loss when they commit.

## Success Metrics
- Visitor-to-member conversion rate over defined timeframes.
- Average response time from visitor inquiry to human follow-up.
- Attendance retention for newcomers across first 3 visits/events.
- Visitor satisfaction/feedback indicating clarity of next steps.

## Open Questions & Follow-Ups
- What digital touchpoints are public vs gated behind authentication?
- How are marketing/communications integrations (e.g., Mailchimp) factored into visitor journeys?
- Are there legal constraints (COPPA, GDPR) for storing visitor data, especially for minors?
- Should visitors have temporary dashboards showing progress toward membership or classes?
