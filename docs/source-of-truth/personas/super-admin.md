# Super Admin Persona Notes

- **Context:** Owns the overall multi-tenant platform and is responsible for provisioning new churches, compliance, and vendor relationships.
- **What they need:** Tenant lifecycle management, billing/usage insights, SLA monitoring, cross-tenant observability, and security oversight.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Mentions multi-client isolation (`BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md`) but does not identify this persona or detail their workflows.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Define super-admin-only surfaces (e.g., platform dashboard, tenant provisioning), formalize governance and audit requirements, and outline escalation paths for platform-wide incidents.
