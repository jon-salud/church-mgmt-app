# Church App Admin Persona Notes

- **Context:** Primary administrator for a single church tenant; configures settings, manages modules, and supports staff adoption.
- **What they need:** Robust role/permission tooling, configuration for request types and workflows, analytics on engagement/attendance, and the ability to delegate tasks.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Aligns loosely with the “Church Administrator” persona but lacks differentiation between day-to-day tenant admins and broader operational roles.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Clarify role-based access expectations, detail dashboard/report requirements, and capture delegation/approvals scenarios across modules.
