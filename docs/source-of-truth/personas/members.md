# Members Persona Notes

- **Context:** Registered congregants engaging with community features, events, giving, and personal profiles.
- **What they need:** Self-service profile management, intuitive request/prayer submission, event discovery/registration, and timely notifications or acknowledgements.
- **Current BRD coverage:** Covers profiles, prayer wall, requests, and basic check-in but omits member-facing onboarding, notifications, or comprehensive event participation tools.
- **Key gaps / follow-ups:** Define member notification strategy, surface-level analytics (e.g., upcoming commitments), and clarify how members engage with events beyond attendance tracking.
