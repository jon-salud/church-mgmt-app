# Tasks

## Work Tracker

Use this file as the single source of truth for what has shipped in the demo MVP and what is still
outstanding. Update it whenever a task meaningfully progresses so the next agent can pick up
quickly. When you pull an item from backlog, move it into **In Progress** before you begin work.

### üîÑ In Progress

### üìù Backlog / Upcoming

- **Onboarding E2E Tests - Technical Debt:**
  - **Testing:** Debug and fix Next.js server-side rendering issue preventing onboarding page from displaying React components. The page currently shows JavaScript code instead of the expected UI. Once resolved, uncomment the onboarding E2E test suite in `web/e2e/onboarding.spec.ts`.

## Phase 1: Complete Core Initial Release Features

- **Document Library:**
  - **Backend:** Develop API endpoints for file uploads (interfacing with a cloud storage service), metadata management, and generating secure, permission-based download URLs.
  - **Frontend:** Create the UI for uploading, viewing, editing, and managing documents and their role-based permissions.

- **Small Group Resource Sharing:**
  - **Backend:** Create CRUD endpoints for managing `group_resources` (title and URL).
  - **Frontend:** Implement the UI for adding and viewing resource links on the group details page.

## Phase 2: Admin Experience & Polish

- **Admin Experience Enhancements:**
  - **Backend:** Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations on custom member profile fields.
  - **Backend:** Add an endpoint to allow assigning a request to a specific staff member.
  - **Frontend:** Build the settings UI for administrators to create and manage custom profile fields.
  - **Frontend:** Add UI controls to the requests dashboard to allow assignment of requests.

  - **Frontend:** Admin interface for defining and managing custom fields (text, date, boolean types).

- **Check-in Location Management:**
  - **Backend:** CRUD endpoints for managing check-in locations.
  - **Frontend:** Admin interface for creating and managing check-in locations used in attendance tracking.

## Phase 3: Developer Experience & Infrastructure

- **API Documentation:**
  - **Backend:** Fully document all remaining API endpoints (Groups, Events, Check-in, etc.) in `docs/source-of-truth/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`.

- **Debug and stabilize E2E test environment:** Fix port conflicts and improve test reliability.

## Technical Debt & Compliance

- **Complete CRUD Operations for All Entities:**
  - **Backend:** Implement full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for all database entities (users, profiles, groups, events, announcements, funds, contributions, households, children, etc.).
  - **Soft Delete Implementation:** Replace hard deletes with soft deletes (add `deletedAt` timestamp) across all entities to maintain data integrity and audit trails.

- **GDPR Compliance Implementation:**
  - **Backend:** Implement data retention policies, right to erasure (soft delete), data portability, and consent management.
  - **Frontend:** Add privacy settings UI, data export functionality, and consent management interfaces.
  - **Audit:** Ensure all personal data handling complies with GDPR requirements including lawful basis for processing.

## Post-MVP (Future Releases)

- **System Administration Application (Epic):**
  - **Backend:** Define and implement the initial set of system-level API endpoints required for platform monitoring (e.g., client usage metrics).
  - **Frontend:** Scaffold the new `admin` Next.js application and implement the basic layout and an initial observability dashboard.
