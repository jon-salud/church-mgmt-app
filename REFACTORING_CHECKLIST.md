## Sprint 5: Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

**Status:** **IN PROGRESS** - Planning phase complete, ready for implementation
**Estimated Start:** October 29, 2025
**Goal:** Build comprehensive integration testing infrastructure with reusable fixtures and utilities
**Success Criteria:** 90%+ test coverage, <2min test execution, integration tests for all major workflows

### Integration Tests (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Repository Integration Tests** - Test real repositories with in-memory store instead of mocks
- [ ] **Service Integration Tests** - Test services with real dependencies (repositories + in-memory store)
- [ ] **Controller Integration Tests** - Test full request/response cycles with real services
- [ ] **Cross-Module Integration Tests** - Test interactions between users, groups, documents, events
- [ ] **Data Consistency Tests** - Verify data integrity across related entities (user-group relationships)

### Test Fixtures (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Entity Builders** - Create fluent builder pattern for User, Group, Document, Event entities
- [ ] **Domain Object Builders** - Builders for domain entities with proper validation
- [ ] **DTO Builders** - Builders for request/response DTOs with realistic data
- [ ] **Relationship Builders** - Builders for complex relationships (user memberships, event attendance)
- [ ] **Fixture Collections** - Pre-built collections of related entities for common scenarios

### Test Utilities (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Test Database Helpers** - Utilities for setting up/cleaning in-memory test databases
- [ ] **Authentication Helpers** - Utilities for creating authenticated test contexts
- [ ] **HTTP Request Builders** - Utilities for building test HTTP requests with proper headers
- [ ] **Assertion Helpers** - Custom matchers for common domain assertions
- [ ] **Time/Date Helpers** - Utilities for testing time-sensitive functionality

### CI Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] **Parallel Test Execution** - Configure Jest to run tests in parallel where safe
- [ ] **Test Categorization** - Separate fast unit tests from slower integration tests
- [ ] **Selective Test Running** - Allow running only affected tests in CI
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring** - Add test execution time tracking and alerts
- [ ] **Test Result Caching** - Cache test results for unchanged code paths

### Test Coverage Improvement (Priority: High)
- [ ] **Datastore Layer Coverage** - Improve coverage for MockDataStoreAdapter and PrismaDataStore
- [ ] **Controller Layer Coverage** - Add tests for error handling and edge cases in controllers
- [ ] **Service Layer Coverage** - Test error scenarios and business rule validations
- [ ] **DTO Validation Coverage** - Test input validation and transformation edge cases
- [ ] **Integration Flow Coverage** - Test complete user journeys and data flows

## Sprint 6: Advanced Patterns & Optimizations
- [ ] **CQRS Pattern** - Separate read/write models where beneficial
- [ ] **Event Sourcing** - Consider for audit-heavy operations
- [ ] **Caching Layer** - Add Redis/memory caching for performance
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker** - Implement resilience patterns
- [ ] **Metrics & Monitoring** - Add application metrics

## Sprint 7: Migration & Cleanup
- [ ] **Prisma Integration** - Complete Prisma datastore implementation
- [ ] **Database Migrations** - Ensure schema compatibility
- [ ] **Environment Parity** - Verify all environments work with new architecture
- [ ] **Documentation Update** - Update all docs to reflect new patterns
- [ ] **Team Training** - Ensure team understands new patterns

## Quality Gates (Applied to Each Sprint)
- [x] **Build Success** - All code compiles without errors
- [x] **Lint Clean** - No linting errors or warnings
- [x] **Tests Pass** - All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] **Type Safety** - Strict TypeScript compliance
- [ ] **Performance** - No performance regressions
- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility** - Existing APIs unchanged

## Current Status
- **Completed Sprints:** 1 (Core DI Abstractions) ✅ MERGED, 2 (Repository Pattern Expansion) ✅ MERGED, 3 (In-Memory Datastore Implementation) ✅ MERGED, 4 (Domain Layer Extraction) ✅ MERGED
- **In Progress:** Sprint 5 (Enhanced Testing Infrastructure)
- **Next Priority:** Add integration tests with real repositories and in-memory store
- **Blockers:** None identified
- **Estimated Completion:** Sprint 5 completion within next session

## Notes
- All changes maintain runtime behavior and API compatibility
- Unit tests provide fast feedback (5-10 seconds vs 2+ minutes for e2e)
- Architecture enables easier testing, maintenance, and future enhancements
- Following DDD principles and SOLID design patterns</content>
