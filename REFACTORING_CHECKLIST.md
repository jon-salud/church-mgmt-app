- [x] **Extend Repository Pattern to Groups** - Create IGroupsRepository interface and adapter
- [x] **DocumentsService Refactor** - Inject repository instead of direct DataStore
- [x] **GroupsService Refactor** - Inject repository instead of direct DataStore (hybrid injection for events)
- [x] **Unit Tests for DocumentsService** - Create unit tests with mocked repository
- [x] **Unit Tests for GroupsService** - Create unit tests with mocked repository

## Sprint 3: In-Memory Datastore Implementation ✅ COMPLETED & MERGED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED & MERGED** - Successfully merged into main branch
**Date Completed:** October 29, 2025
**Tests:** 123/123 passing (100% coverage on new abstractions)
**Review:** All feedback addressed and resolved

- [x] **InMemoryDataStore Service** - Create in-memory implementation of DataStore interface
- [x] **InMemoryDataStoreAdapter** - Adapter for repository pattern compatibility
- [x] **Environment Configuration** - Add DATA_MODE=memory option
- [x] **CI/CD Integration** - Use in-memory store for faster CI tests
- [x] **Data Seeding** - Implement mock data seeding for in-memory store

## Sprint 4: Domain Layer Extraction ✅ COMPLETED & MERGED

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED & MERGED** - Successfully merged into main branch
**Date Completed:** October 29, 2025
**Tests:** 158/158 passing (100% coverage on domain layer)
**Review:** All feedback addressed and resolved

- [x] **Domain Entities** - Extract User, Document, Group domain objects with immutability and soft deletes
- [x] **Value Objects** - Create immutable value objects (Email, ChurchId, UserId, DocumentId, GroupId) with validation
- [x] **Domain Services** - Extract business logic into domain services with relationship logic
- [x] **Repository Interfaces** - Updated to use domain types while maintaining backwards compatibility
- [x] **Application Services** - Refactored services to convert between DTOs and domain objects
- [x] **Unit Tests** - Comprehensive tests for all domain objects and updated service tests
- [x] **Backwards Compatibility** - All 158 API tests pass, no breaking changes to external APIs

## Sprint 5: Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **Integration Tests** - Add tests that use real repositories with in-memory store
- [ ] **Test Fixtures** - Create reusable test data builders
- [ ] **Test Utilities** - Helper functions for common test scenarios
- [ ] **CI Performance** - Ensure all tests run under 2 minutes
- [ ] **Test Coverage** - Maintain 90%+ coverage across all modules

## Sprint 6: Advanced Patterns & Optimizations
- [ ] **CQRS Pattern** - Separate read/write models where beneficial
- [ ] **Event Sourcing** - Consider for audit-heavy operations
- [ ] **Caching Layer** - Add Redis/memory caching for performance
- [ ] **Circuit Breaker** - Implement resilience patterns
- [ ] **Metrics & Monitoring** - Add application metrics

## Sprint 7: Migration & Cleanup
- [ ] **Prisma Integration** - Complete Prisma datastore implementation
- [ ] **Database Migrations** - Ensure schema compatibility
- [ ] **Environment Parity** - Verify all environments work with new architecture
- [ ] **Documentation Update** - Update all docs to reflect new patterns
- [ ] **Team Training** - Ensure team understands new patterns

## Quality Gates (Applied to Each Sprint)
- [x] **Build Success** - All code compiles without errors
- [x] **Lint Clean** - No linting errors or warnings
- [x] **Tests Pass** - All existing tests continue to pass
- [x] **Type Safety** - Strict TypeScript compliance
- [ ] **Performance** - No performance regressions
- [ ] **Backwards Compatibility** - Existing APIs unchanged

## Current Status
- **Completed Sprints:** 1 (Core DI Abstractions) ✅ MERGED, 2 (Repository Pattern Expansion) ✅ MERGED, 3 (In-Memory Datastore Implementation) ✅ MERGED, 4 (Domain Layer Extraction) ✅ MERGED
- **In Progress:** Sprint 5 (Enhanced Testing Infrastructure)
- **Next Priority:** Add integration tests with real repositories and in-memory store
- **Blockers:** None identified
- **Estimated Completion:** Sprint 5 completion within next session

## Notes
- All changes maintain runtime behavior and API compatibility
- Unit tests provide fast feedback (5-10 seconds vs 2+ minutes for e2e)
- Architecture enables easier testing, maintenance, and future enhancements
- Following DDD principles and SOLID design patterns</content>
