# Codex Agent Guidance

## Instructions

1. **Start with `TASKS.md`.** Read the tracker before doing anything else so you understand which items are done, in progress, or queued. Update the relevant section as you make progress.
2. **Keep plans current.** When a request spans multiple pieces of work, create a plan (minimum two steps) and update it after each step completes.
3. **Prefer incremental PRD alignment.** When picking up a backlog item, cross-check the PRD to ensure acceptance criteria are covered before marking it complete.
4. **Respect the mock data constraints.** The MVP currently runs off the in-memory mock store. When adding features, extend the mock layer first and keep API contracts consistent with the long-term Prisma schema.
5. **Validate when possible.** Run targeted tests or linting that relate to your changes. If tests are skipped (e.g. due to time or environment), call that out in your final message.
6. **Document notable gaps.** If you uncover missing pieces or future follow-ups, append them to the backlog section in `TASKS.md` so they do not get lost.
