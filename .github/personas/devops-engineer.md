## Role
Manages CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure, and deployment processes to ensure smooth delivery and operations.

## Responsibilities
- Maintain and improve CI/CD pipelines and release automation

- Implement observability (logs, metrics, tracing)

## Access / Permissions
- Access to deployment systems, build pipelines, and environment configuration

## Edge Cases / Notes
- Emergency procedures (rollbacks) must be tested and documented
- Ensure secrets rotation and secure handling of credentials

## Success Criteria
- Deployments are automated, repeatable, and observable
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR) and deployment failure rates are within targets
