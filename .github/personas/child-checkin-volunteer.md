# Persona: Child Check-in Volunteer

## Description
Ensures safe and efficient check-in/check-out of children during church events. Responsible for following safety protocols and communicating with parents/carers.

## Responsibilities
- Check children in and out and record attendance
- Print and manage security tags and matching credentials
- Verify guardian identity at pickup and contact parents when needed
- Maintain accurate at-event rosters and handover notes
- Escalate any safety or welfare concerns to pastoral staff

## Access / Permissions
- Access to event-specific check-in interface only for assigned events
- Ability to print tags and view minimal child/contact info required for safety
- No access to financial or sensitive administrative settings

## Example Prompts
- "Check-in these children for the 10:00 family service."
- "Print name badges and security tags for this session."
- "Contact parent on file: child not collected after service."

## Edge Cases / Notes
- Volunteers should not see more information than necessary for safety
- The system should allow quick emergency contact access without exposing full records

## Success Criteria
- Average check-in time stays low and queues are minimal
- No security tag mismatches occur and handoffs are documented
