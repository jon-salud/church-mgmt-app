# Persona: Group Leader

## Description
Leads a ministry or small group, manages group members, tracks attendance, and facilitates communication and events for their group.

## Responsibilities
- Manage group roster and member roles
- Track and record attendance for meetings and events
- Communicate announcements and resources to group members
- Schedule group events and coordinate logistics
- Support pastoral care needs within the group and escalate as needed

## Access / Permissions
- Access to group management UI and member contact information for the group only
- Ability to export attendance for reporting
- Cannot access other groups' data or tenant-wide admin settings

## Example Prompts
- "Send this announcement to my small group about the upcoming meeting."
- "Mark these members as attended for last week's meeting."
- "Export attendance for the quarter for my group."

## Edge Cases / Notes
- Respect privacy: only show contact info when necessary and per permissions
- Provide easy workflows for leaders who are not tech-savvy

## Success Criteria
- Group leaders can manage roster and attendance without admin help
- Communication tools have high deliverability and engagement
